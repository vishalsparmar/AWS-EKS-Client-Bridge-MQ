3.2 OneAgent Automatic JMS Detection

The OneAgent will automatically detect:

JMS connections from your Spring service
Message processing times
Error rates
Throughput
What you'll see automatically:

Service: YourSpringJmsService
Metrics: jms.service.message.processed, jms.service.message.processingTime
PurePaths: Detailed traces of message processing
Part 4: Verification and Dashboard Creation

4.1 Verify Data Flow

Check ActiveGate Status:

Dynatrace → Deployment status → Verify ActiveGate is connected
Check Extension Status:

Settings → Monitoring → Monitored technologies
Find "IBM MQ" and verify it's active
Verify Metrics:

Go to Data Explorer
Search for: ibmmq_queue_message_count
You should see your mainframe queues
4.2 Create Comprehensive Dashboard

Build a dashboard that shows:

Application Side (from EKS/OneAgent):

Service response time
JMS message processing rate
Error count
Infrastructure Side (from Mainframe/ActiveGate):

Mainframe queue depths
Messages in/out rates
Channel status
4.3 Key Metrics to Monitor

sql
# Queue depth alerting
ibmmq_queue_message_count > 1000

# Service performance
jms.service.message.processingTime > 30s

# Error correlation
(jms.service.failure > 0) AND (ibmmq_queue_message_count > 5000)
Troubleshooting Common Issues

❌ ActiveGate cannot connect to Mainframe MQ

Solution:

Verify network connectivity from ActiveGate host to mainframe
Check firewall rules
Validate MQ credentials and permissions
❌ EKS pods cannot connect to Mainframe MQ

Solution:

Test connectivity from EKS node
Check DNS resolution in EKS
Verify MQ client configuration in Spring app
❌ No JMS metrics in Dynatrace

Solution:

Verify OneAgent is injected into your Spring pods
Check that JMS technology is enabled in Dynatrace
Restart ActiveGate after extension deployment
❌ SSL handshake failures

Solution:

Ensure correct cipher specs on ActiveGate
Verify certificates are properly configured
Check mainframe MQ SSL configuration
Summary

Your setup will now provide:

✅ End-to-end visibility from EKS Spring app to mainframe MQ
✅ Application performance metrics from OneAgent
✅ Infrastructure metrics from mainframe MQ via ActiveGate
✅ Correlation between app performance and queue health
The key is that the ActiveGate bridges the gap between your cloud-native EKS environment and your traditional mainframe infrastructure.
